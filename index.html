                        I have eight years of experience in the technical field managing daily production cycles and continuous improvement activities. From going it solo to training and coordinating team efforts, I know how to accomplish project milestones ahead of schedule and under budget. From manufacturing PCB's to troubleshooting and maintaining CNC equipment, I've always been elbow deep in digital electronics in one fashion or another.

                        <li id="" class="">

                        Hail Hephaestus. May the fires of a thousand forges light your way.

                        When my hands aren't at a keyboard manipulating the digital realms, they yearn to reshape the real world anew. The roar of the flame as the metal becomes red hot; the ring of the anvil as the hammer strikes; the shower of sparks like festive fireworks; the hiss of brine setting the metal's fibers in place by ripping out its warmth. For every act of creation to come into being, there must be a series of acts of destruction that herald it forth. Within the forge there exists a microcosmos of extreme environments that break down what enters and transform it into the image held within your mind.
                    </p>

                        As an artist at heart, I appreciate all of its forms. When I'm not at my own workbench listening to the call of my muse, I am usually dabbling in other crafts and art forms in one way or another. My favorite late night quiet activities are writing, drawing, composing music, practicing vocals, and working with fabric. My personal goals are to produce a cartoon and a video game as a solo indie developer, and to build a fully automated forge with a foundry.
