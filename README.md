###### Developing a better web experience

## Welcome!

This is my corner of the webiverse; I expect it to be taken care of and kept clean.

If you're here looking for something to bring some joy into your life, go browse the content.

If you're here looking for a sotware developer, just contact me about the project you have in mind.

## The Specifics

This website is being developed primarily to run on the most up-to-date Chrome and Firefox browsers, with future support for other browsers and versions rolling out as development occurs. Most of the content is front-end facing with little to no need for a back end at this time. This is to keep production simple and to keep the user experience both lightweight and fast.

The technologies employed will be HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The use of libraries, frameworks, and engines will be avoided so as to encourage developing solutions in pure JavaScript. This is because I want to. With this being my website, that's a perfectly valid reason.

## What's happened?
